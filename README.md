# Bengaluru House Price Prediction

## 🏠 Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using Machine Learning. The model is trained on real estate data and provides estimated prices based on various input parameters such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Backend & Frontend:** Flask (Full-stack implementation)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database:** CSV Dataset
- **Deployment:** (Mention if hosted on any platform)

## 📌 Features
- Predicts house prices based on user input.
- Interactive web-based UI built with Flask templates.
- Flask API for backend processing.
- Data pre-processing and feature engineering for improved predictions.
- Model evaluation and optimization for accuracy.

## 🛠 Installation and Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/falakrana/bengluruHousePrediction.git
cd bengluruHousePrediction
```
### 2️⃣ Setup Flask Environment
```bash
cd application
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## 🖥 Usage
1. Open the application in your browser (`http://localhost:5000` by default).
2. Enter the required house details (location, size, etc.).
3. Click the **Predict** button to get an estimated price.

## 📊 Dataset Details
- The dataset includes location, size, total square footage, and price information.
- Pre-processing involves handling missing values, feature encoding, and data normalization.

## 📈 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Linear Regression (or mention if using Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
- Trained using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluated using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with advanced ML/DL techniques.
- Add more features like amenities, nearby infrastructure.
- Deploy using AWS/GCP/Heroku.
